# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Stand up a basic honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting and/or collecting data about an attack.

## Honeypots Deployed

1. Ubuntu Dionaea
2. Ubuntu Snort

## Issues Encountered

Setting up the virtual environments were time consuming and tricky. There are also some issues on Windows so I had to switch to my Mac.

## Summary of Data Collected

Using Google Cloud Platform and HoneyPot to setup, I've collected the following data from attackers.

### TOP 5 Attacker IPs:

1. 118.24.244.172 (295 attacks)
2. 104.248.6.137 (36 attacks)
3. 188.165.3.85 (33 attacks)
4. 162.243.160.49 (31 attacks)
5. 142.93.33.221 (29 attacks)

### TOP 5 Attacked Ports

1. 8088 (409 times)
2. 80 (298 times)
3. 23 (55 times)
4. 5060 (42 times)
5. 8080 (25 times)

### TOP 5 Honey Pots

1. dionaea (1,110 attacks)
2. snort (220 attacks)

## Unresolved Questions Raised by Data Collected

1. Is there a way to alert users when attack was detected?
2. Why are some ports more vulnerable than other ports?
